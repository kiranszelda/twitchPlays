# Twitch Plays

### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

---

## Requirements

- Node JS (min version v0.11.3)
- Program to control computer (Ex. xdotool)
- Twitch account and app
- Twitch oauth key with chat:read access

## Setup

If you already have a key just download or clone the program and edit the values in TwitchPlays.js, then run it with node

If you don't have a key then go to the twitch developer console, create an app, then put your client secret and client id codes in here and select chat:read as "yes" [twitchtokengenerator.com](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/)
After that copy the code they give into the TwitchPlays.js file as well as fill out everything else.
